# Advanced Task Management API

## Introduction

The Advanced Task Management API provides a robust framework for managing tasks within projects, incorporating advanced features such as task dependencies, real-time notifications, and comprehensive security measures. This API supports various task types, including Bugs, Features, and Improvements, and facilitates detailed performance analysis through periodic reporting.

Built with Laravel, this API leverages JWT for secure authentication, includes mechanisms to protect against common security vulnerabilities, and manages user roles and permissions effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. **Task Management**
- **Task Creation and Updates**: Create and update tasks with attributes like title, description, type, status, priority, and due date.
- **Task Dependencies**: Automatically set a taskâ€™s status to "Blocked" if it depends on another task that is incomplete.
- **Auto Reset**: Change the status of dependent tasks from "Blocked" to "Open" when their prerequisites are completed.
- **Soft Delete**: Support for soft deletion of tasks, allowing restoration while retaining historical data.

### 2. **Commenting and Attachments**
- **Comments**: Add comments to tasks for improved collaboration.
- **Attachments**: Upload and manage file attachments securely, including encryption and virus checking.

### 3. **User and Role Management**
- **User Assignment**: Assign tasks to users and manage user roles to control access permissions.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Implement a role management system to define specific permissions for users based on their roles.

### 4. **Reporting and Performance Analysis**
- **Daily Task Reports**: Generate periodic reports for analysis.
- **Multiple Report Types**: Support for generating various reports, including completed tasks, overdue tasks, and tasks by user.

### 5. **Advanced Security Features**
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to the API using JWT tokens.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect the API from DDoS attacks through rate limiting.
- **CSRF Protection**: Ensure protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **XSS and SQL Injection Protection**: Utilize Laravel's built-in mechanisms to prevent XSS and SQL Injection attacks.
